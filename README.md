Maker of robots and other cool things.

Most things on this profile are either random stuff I've been allowed to make public or me trying to fix some stuff I use.

Most of the activity you see is from all the private repos of stuff I'm not allowed to make public (or I use to manage dotfiles and the like).

If you are an employer looking at this, check out my linkedin instead for job history. If you want to know what I'm good at and how I code, lots of stuff here might be too old to be representative, but just trust me when I say that I have a lot of professional experience in C, C++, Python and am currently working on developing my Rust (but I'm limited since no job I've worked at does Rust yet).

Anyways thanks for reading this. You are a cool dude :)
